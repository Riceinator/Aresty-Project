# Aresty-Project

This project was done in collaboration with Dr. Weihong Guo, part of the Rutgers Industrial and Systems Engineering faculty (link: https://ise.rutgers.edu/weihong-guo).
The project was to determine anomalous and non-anomalous layers in a 3-D printed part and then see if we can forecast these anomalous layers using machine learning. 
The Mean Value Calculations File should be run first, and it is usually the first code to execute as it extracts hundreds of thousands of datapoints from over 
300 .hdf5 files. The mean value then extracts the values from each of these values iteratively, then calculates the mean value of each. This is the preprocessing portion
of the project. After, the machine learning technique was applied to the data.
